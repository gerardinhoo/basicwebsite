         <img src="Carreer.jpg" alt= "favorite carreer">
       <p>It has always been difficult for me to choose a major after high school because I wasn't sure of what I will be doing in the future or what my carreer will be. One thing I have known for sure is that if you work hard for something you want then You will surely achieve it. Even though I wasn't certain of what I wanted to do, I always told myself that I will end up making the right decision.
        After majoring in Health science in my first year of college, I realized thatI wanted to major in something else.</p>
      
      <p>
       Over the summer, I started doing some research about the job in demand and I found out that there are lots of opportunities in the <em>technology field</em> so I changed my major in the following semester to <b>information technology</b>. Few weeks ago a friend of mine recommended me <b>Udacity Course</b> so that I can get my dream job. By next year I would like to get a job as front end developer and started a carreer as a web developer. I know it requires hard work and sacrifice but I intend to work hard to make it happen and be a professional web deveoper in the near future. </p>

       
        <h2 id="b">Sports Passion</h2>

       <p>I love <em>Sports</em> in general but my most three favorites sports are <b>Soccer, Tennis, Basketball</b>. Among those Three Sports, my most favorite is <b>Soccer</b>. I've been playing soccer since I was kid and never stopped since then. While it's fun to play with my friends, I also love to win. I'm a player who likes to compete. I got the chance to win lots of throphees, Individual and collectives while playing in tournaments and  leagues.</p>
       <p>My favorite player is <b>Ronaldinho</b> from Brazil who retired a while ago from the giant European club <b>Barcelona Fc</b> in Spain.He has been my inspiration and I loved watching Him play and like to play like Him.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnj64DsO8T8">A link to <b>Ronaldinho's</b> highlights.</a></p>

      <p>Music is one the greatest thing that ever exiated. Either You're singing or listenning to a song, it makes you feel different types of ways. I personnally love any good music especially oldies but <em>French,Latino and Country music</em> are my favourite types of music.

Also visit <b>Hawaii</b> to see beautiful beaches.I would also love to visit a country like <b>Brazil</b> to see how Rio De Janeiro and Sao Paulo look like. Overral there are tons of countries I'd like to visit and enjoy their sites of attractions, learn their culture and their language as well.If there's one thing I would also love to do, is the opportunity to travel around the world through the five continents with my friends and make connectios with some other new friends.</p>
